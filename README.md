# Movie Genre Classification
# This project involves building a Machine Learning model to classify movies into their respective genres based on plot descriptions. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF and Word Embeddings were applied to extract meaningful features from the text. Various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning (LSTM) were experimented with to achieve high classification accuracy.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLP

Goal: Predict movie genres accurately using plot summaries.

Key Skills: Text Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Model Evaluation
